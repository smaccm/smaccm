<h2 id="sec:dataflow_language">Dataflow Language</h2>
<p>The AGREE language is derived from the <em>synchronous dataflow language</em> Lustre. Let us expand on this definition somewhat. A <em>dataflow</em> language consists of a set of <em>equations</em> that assign <em>variables</em> in which a variable can be computed as soon as its <em>data dependencies</em> have been computed. As an example, consider a system that computes the values of two variables, <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, based on four inputs: <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, and <code>d</code>:</p>

<p>This diagram is to be read left-to-right, with the inputs &quot;flowing&quot; through the system of operators to create the outputs at the right side. The diagram can be represented more concisely as a set of equations, as shown at right. We name the inputs to the dataflow model <em>input variables</em> and all variables that are computed by the model <em>state variables.</em></p>
<p>As the basis of a high-level programming language, the dataflow model has several merits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is a completely functional model without side effects. This feature makes the model well-suited to formal verification and program transformation. It also facilitates reuse, as a module will behave the same way in any context into which it is embedded.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a naturally parallel model, in which the only constraints on parallelism are enforced by the data-dependencies between variables. This allows for parallel implementations to be realized, either in software, or directly in hardware.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dataflow models can be either <em>synchronous</em> or <em>asynchronous</em>. In an asynchronous dataflow model, the outputs of the system are continually recomputed depending on the inputs to the system. In the synchronous model, however, real-time is broken into a sequence of instants in which the model is recomputed. The synchronous model is better suited to translation into a programming language, as it more naturally matches the behavior of a computer program. Therefore, all of the dataflow-style languages adopt some form of this approach.</p>
<p>The variables in a dataflow model are used to label a particular computation graph; they are not used as constraints. Therefore, it is incorrect to view the equations as a set of constraints on the model: a set of equations such as {<code>X = 2a/Y</code>, <code>Y = X + d</code>} does not correspond to an operator network because X and Y mutually refer to one another. Put another way, there is no way to arrange the variables from left to right such that each can be computed. This is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:dataflow_model_cyclic">2</a>, where the bold red-lines indicate the cyclic dependencies. Such a system may have no solution or infinitely many solutions, so cannot be directly used as a deterministic program. If viewed as a graph, these sets of equations have <em>data dependency cycles</em>, and are considered incorrect.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, in order for the language to be useful, we must be able to have mutual reference between variables. To allow benign cyclic dependencies, a <em>delay operator</em> (<code>prev</code>) is added. The operator returns the value of an expression, delayed one instant. For example: {<code>X = 2a + Y</code>; <code>Y = (prev(X, 1)) + d</code>} defines a system where <code>X</code> is equal to <code>2a</code> plus the current value of <code>Y</code>, while <code>Y</code> is equal to the <em>previous</em> value of <code>X</code> (with value in the initial instant set to <code>1</code>) plus the current value of <code>d</code>. Systems of equations of this form always have a single solution. The delay operator is also the mechanism for recording state about the model. For example, we can construct a counter over the natural numbers by simply defining the equation: <code>x = prev(x+1, 1)</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, some notion of selection is added to assignment expressions. In Lustre, this is simply an if/then/else statement. From these elements, at its core, a dataflow program can be viewed as simply a set of input variables and assignment equations of the form {<code>X</code><sub><code>0</code></sub> = <code>E</code><sub><code>0</code></sub>, <code>X</code><sub><code>1</code></sub> = <code>E</code><sub><code>1</code></sub>, ..., <code>X</code><sub><code>n</code></sub> = <code>E</code><sub><code>n</code></sub>} that must be acyclic in terms of data dependencies.</p>
