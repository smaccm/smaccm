Notes
=====
The AGREE plugin is only packaged with the SMTInterpol SMT solver. If you want to use other solvers ([Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3),
[Yices (version 1)](http://yices.csl.sri.com/download-yices1.shtml), 
[Yices 2](http://yices.csl.sri.com/index.shtml),
[CVC4](http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/web/), or
[MathSAT](http://mathsat.fbk.eu/)) you will need to obtain them separately and set your PATH environment variable to point at their location.  In order to perform Realizability Analysis you must have Z3 installed.

**If you have trouble installing the updates you might need to run OSATE as administrator.**
