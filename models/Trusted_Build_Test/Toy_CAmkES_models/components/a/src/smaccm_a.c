   using Dulcimer AADL system build tool suite 

   ***AUTOGENERATED CODE: DO NOT MODIFY***

  This C file contains the implementations of the AADL primitives
  used by user-level declarations for thread a.   

  The user code runs in terms of "dispatchers", which cause 
  dispatch user-level handlers to execute.  These handlers can 
  communicate using the standard AADL primitives, which are mapped
  to C functions.

  The send/receive handlers are not thread safe; it is assumed that 
  this is handled by the CAmkES sequentialized access to the dispatch
  handler.  There is only one dispatch interface for the component
  containing all of the dispatch points.

  The read/write handlers are thread safe because the writer comes 
  through a dispatch interface but the reader is "local" on a dispatch
  interface and so contention may occur.
